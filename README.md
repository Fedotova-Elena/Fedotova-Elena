## Projects
### Game Player Retention analysis.

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/ProjectOne) 

This is a SQL project using Big Query for a database system.
In this project I analysed the 30-day player retention rate for a game company. 
Specific interest of this analysis is a correlation between player's spending and retention rate. 

### WEB Analysis for SF.gov

Created a dashboard using Tableau to visualize annual data from a SF.gov website. 
The goal of this project is to explore the correlation between bounce rate and average time spent on each web page.

### Beer Consumption Prediction

This is a linear regression problem: based on information about weather and beer consumption I predict how much beer will be consumed. In this project, I analyzed how beer consumption depends on the weather conditions in São Paulo, Brazil.

### Travel Insurance Prediction Project

I created a customer demographic analysis in Tableau and build a classification model using Python that can predict if the customer will be interested in buying the travel insurance package.
